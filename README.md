========
A Rust project scaffold which has minimal project structure to get started in 
Rust development.

###Development Tip

1. Hot reloads using cargo watch. 
    *Use the following command for quiet mode runs.
        `cargo watch -q -c -x 'run -q'`

2. **Optional** Use [live-server](https://github.com/lomirus/live-server) if 
   there is a need for live reload and you only need it for frontend development.
